# Login Flow Test Guide

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Role Selection UI**
- ✅ Removed admin/user radio buttons from login page
- ✅ Updated form state to only include email and password
- ✅ Updated page description to mention automatic admin detection

### 2. **Implemented Automatic Role Detection**
- ✅ Modified `AuthContext.login()` to try admin login first, then user login
- ✅ Updated Google sign-in to also use automatic role detection
- ✅ Updated auto-sync logic in useEffect to try both roles

### 3. **Updated Login Logic**
- ✅ Login now automatically determines user role based on credentials
- ✅ Admin users are redirected to `/admin/dashboard`
- ✅ Regular users are redirected to `/dashboard`

## How It Works

1. **User enters credentials** on login page
2. **System tries admin login first** - if successful, user is admin
3. **If admin login fails**, system tries user login
4. **User is redirected** based on their actual role in the database
5. **No manual role selection** required from the user

## Testing Steps

### Test Admin Login:
1. Go to login page
2. Enter admin email and password
3. Click "Sign In"
4. Should redirect to `/admin/dashboard`

### Test User Login:
1. Go to login page  
2. Enter regular user email and password
3. Click "Sign In"
4. Should redirect to `/dashboard`

### Test Google Sign-In:
1. Go to login page
2. Click "Sign in with Google"
3. Complete Google authentication
4. Should redirect based on user's role in database

## Expected Behavior

- **Admin users**: Automatically redirected to admin dashboard
- **Regular users**: Automatically redirected to user dashboard
- **Invalid credentials**: Shows error message
- **No role selection needed**: System determines role automatically

## Database Requirements

Make sure you have:
- At least one admin user in your MongoDB with `role: "admin"`
- Regular users with `role: "user"`
- Users should have `isActive: true` in the database
